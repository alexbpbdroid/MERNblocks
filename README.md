# Blox

### Blox 

Blox is a music production application that allows people with no musical background or experience to create music.

### Background and Overview

Many people are interested in music, however they lack any musical experience and believe themselves to be musically inept. Enter Blox, a simple and easy way to create music. Blox are the new notes in our new world of music and users can intuitively select the right blox which vary in size, shape and color based on their length and pitch. Put enough blox together and you will have created a whole song!

We will need to:
  * Build a database to store data for users, music, etc.
  * Implement a web application for creation of music using blocks
  * Create website where users can create accounts, create, share and edit music, as well as comment and rate other users' music

  ### Technologies and Technical Challenges
  
  Blox's web application will be built with MongoDB on the backend in order to save user data and all the data associated with those users. To create the music creation component of our application, the tonaljs library will be used in conjunction with our database and React.js on the front end. 
  
  Backend: MongoDB/Express and tonaljs library
  
  Frontend: React/Node.js
  
  Technical challenges:
  
  The main challenge for our team will be building the music creation component of the application. In addition to using data from an external library, we will have to create an intuitive user interface which any user can use to create music. We will also have to collect the musical data generated by users and store it on the database, then allow users to edit and delete it.
