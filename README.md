# Blox

### Blox 

Blox is a music production application that allows people with no musical background or experience to create music.

### Background and Overview

Many people are interested in music, however they lack any musical experience and believe themselves to be musically inept. Enter Blox, a simple and easy way to create music. Blox are the new notes in our new world of music and users can intuitively select the right blox which vary in size, shape and color based on their length and pitch. Put enough blox together and you will have created a whole song!

We will need to:
  * Build a database to store data for users, music, etc.
  * Implement a web application for creation of music using blocks
  * Create website where users can create accounts, create, share and edit music, as well as comment and rate other users' music
